What was originally planned for your final project

It was always going to be about Batman. Ever since I was a kid I liked the batman movies. They were always really entertaining to me and I loved the villians.

What was delivered in your Final Project

A batman website was delivered in my final project. It talks about my favorite Batman movies and Dc movies in general.

What would be the next feature(s) you would add if you had more time

If I had more time I would also add a background that changes color as well as a picture ofme drawing Batman on my website.
