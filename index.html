    <p> This movie is about a billionaire kid named Bruce Wayne who witnessed his parents die right in front of him. After this he realized 
        that he does not want this to happen to anyone else ever again so he leaves the country and embarks on a journey to train 
    himself and learn how to protect himself and others. He then went to the Himalayan mountains where he met a mysterious man by the name
        of Ras al Ghul who ran a organization called the "league of shadows" and they taught him how to get past the pain of his parents death and
     taught him how to defend himself and punish evil. Bruce later realized he did not agree with how extreme Ras's methods were since he wanted to execute criminals and Bruce thought nobody deserved to
    die, even criminals. Bruce then betrayed Ras, left his organization and went back to his home town to stop crime there and became a hero known
    as Batman who stops criminals.    </p>
